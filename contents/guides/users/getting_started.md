## What does “diaspora\*” mean?

The word “diaspora” refers to the dispersal of seeds (or people) over a wide area. That’s why our motif is the dandelion, and the asterisk in our name represents a fluffy dandelion seed. We refer to the servers that are part of the diaspora\* network as “pods”. You’ll get used to it soon!

## How do I choose my pod?

Unlike most social networking sites, which have a central hub of computers which store everyone’s data, we can’t give you one specific link and say: “Sign up here.” diaspora\* is different from those networks in that it is decentralized, with many different points of access. Before getting started, you’ll have to decide which of these points you want to use to access the diaspora\* network. We call these nodes “pods.” 

This decentralized approach offers you the freedom to choose where your personal data is stored. Each pod has a different domain name, and is managed by different people on different servers in different physical locations. Don't worry – all pods connect to the same diaspora\* network, and once you sign up you'll be communicating and sharing with users across all pods, not just users in your own pod. It's really just a question of where the content you share will be physically hosted, as a security and privacy concern.

You might have received an invitation to join diaspora\* from someone you know. If so, this contains a link to the diaspora\* pod on which the person who invited you is registered. If you want to join to the same pod as them, you can simply follow the link in the mail. However, you don’t have to be on the same pod as your friend to communicate with them. You can choose any pod you want as your home and talk to people throughout diaspora\*.

It is important that you remember which diaspora\* pod you signed up because you will always sign in on the same pod with which you first registered. You will not be able to sign in to another pod, but there is no need for you to do this anyway as you can connect to the whole network and your experience of diaspora\* should be more or less the same no matter which pod you are connecting from.

To help you choose which pod is best for you, there are some tools which provide useful information:

* [Pod Uptime][poduptime] lists the information that is most relevant to those looking to sign up.
* [The Federation][thefederation] collects detailed statistics via the opt-in statistics feature that is built into diaspora\*. 

There are many possible factors you could consider when choosing a pod, but here are the typical things you want to consider as a newcomer:

* **Open signups**: You can only join a pod that currently lists signups as “Open”.
* **Software version**: Ideally you want a pod which is kept regularly updated to the latest stable version of the diaspora\* software.
* **Physical location**: You may want to choose a pod based in a country which you believe has good policies on data security. This is completely up to you. (Also keep in mind that a pod hosted on the other side of the world from you might respond slower than a pod closer to you.)
* **Domain name**: A pod can literally have *any* domain name, and technically the name doesn't matter much since you'll be connecting to the same network no matter what. However, your pod's domain name will be part of your diaspora\* username, so you might prefer something that is easy to remember, something you'd want to tell your friends about, etc.

If you want, you can even host your own data by running your own diaspora\* pod. You can find more about this at the [Guides for podmins][podmin_guides].

## What should I do after I signed up?

After registration you get to a site where you are asked to fill in fields for your name, upload a profile image, and some interesting hashtags you want to follow. You don’t have to use your real name if you don’t want to. In diaspora\*, you can be who you want to be. If you're unsure what to enter, don't worry: you can also fill or change them later in your settings. But the more information you provide, the better people can find you and assess if they want to share with you. 

Especially entering hashtags that you're interested in at *What are you into?* is an awesome first step to fill your *Stream* with interesting posts and people. It doesn't matter if you write them lower-case or upper-case, they all link to the same site.

You can read more about following hashtags at “[How do I view and find content?][view_and_find_content]”

## How do I introduce myself to other users?

After you finished the form with your basic info, you get to the main *Stream* for the first time. Your main stream is populated with all of your contacts, tags you follow, and posts from some creative members of the community (Community spotlight). It may seem a little empty at the beginning, but you can change that quickly!

diaspora\* invites you to introduce yourself! The easiest way to do this is by writing a NewHere-post.
Your first post is already pre-filled with “Hey everyone, I’m #newhere. I’m interested in ...” followed by the list of tags you entered on the first page. You can share this post as it is, or edit its content if you want to personalize it. This way, people who follow that tag will see your post and be able to welcome you. Include some of your interests as #tags as well, and you’ll find that people with similar interests to you will find you. With the dropdown at the bottom right of the publisher field you can control the visibility of your post. The default setting for your *first* post is *public* and you shouldn't change this as nobody could see your post otherwise – but it will be publicly visible to everyone, so maybe don't share all private details publicly. The other options that you can see there are *aspects* which means that you post to only your contacts.

You can read more about aspects at “[What are aspects and how do I use them?][aspects]” and more about the difference of public and private content at “[How does diaspora* give me control over publishing my data?][control_over_publishing_data]”

Your suggested first post already contains some tags if you entered your interests on the first page. By using hashtags you can classify your posts and find people who share your interests. In your first post the hashtag “#NewHere” is pre-filled. This special hashtag is perfect for introductions. In later posts, use whichever tags go with your post's content.

## How do I find people to share with?

If you published a NewHere-Post, people will eventually show up and welcome you. You can take a look at their profiles and decide if you want to start sharing with them. One good way to discover interesting content and people is to search for hashtags and take a look at who posts interesting content tagged with this hashtag. You can follow these hashtags and add all those who post things that interest you to an aspect, even if you don't know them (yet)!

Sometimes, even if you know someone already uses diaspora\*, they don't show up if you search them by name. In this case, you should ask them for their full diaspora\* ID (e.g. username@pod.tld). You can always find them if you search for their full ID. If you miss your friends from other platforms, you can invite your friends by using the email link in the sidebar.

On many pods, you already see some content in your *Stream* right after you signed up. These users are part of your pods *Community spotlight*, where your podmin can add accounts they consider interesting for their new users. These can be removed by unchecking the “Show community spotlight in stream?” option in the *Account* tab of your *Settings*.

## How can I edit my profile?

In the beginning, you were only asked to enter your basic information like your name, an image, and some hashtags you might want to follow. If you want, you can add more information about you on your profile. On the screen you’re taken to, click your name or avatar at the right-hand end of the header bar, and select *Profile* from the list which drops down. Then click the *Edit my profile* button in the top right corner. You can add information like a bio, your gender, birthday, or location. Don’t forget to click the *Update profile* button once you’re finished!
