## How can I mention someone?

You can grab someone's attention by “mentioning” them? Simply type a “@” symbol and the first few characters of the name of one of your contacts. As you start typing their name (their screen name, not their user name), diaspora\* will suggest people to you. Note that it is only possible to mention people you have added to an aspect. Once you select a name, you'll notice that it has changed to their full diaspora\* ID in curly braces. Don't worry, though; this will become an @mention once you have posted the message. The person you are mentioning will receive a notification of the mention on their notification page, and by email if they have asked to receive email notification of mentions. Likewise other people can @mention you, and you’ll receive a notification in the header bar (and by email if you have set that option).

You can @mention people in both posts and comments. You can mention someone in a comment the same way you would do it in a post, by typing “@” and then start typing their name. Please note that when you comment on a post which is not public, you can only mention users who have already interacted with the post.

You can find all posts in which you've been mentioned by clicking “@Mentions” in the left-hand column on your main Stream page. 

## How can I start a private conversation?

A conversation is a private communication between two or more people. To access this feature, click the envelope icon in the header bar.

The conversations page in the desktop interface consists of two columns: on the left, a list of conversations you have been involved in; on the right, a view of the currently selected conversation (if any).

Use the New conversation button at the top of the left-hand column to start a new conversation. The button will open a pop-up window in which you can write a message and add people to include in the conversation. You can only start conversations with people with whom you have mutual sharing.

When typing a name into the “to” line, the name will be auto-completed, just like when you @mention someone in a post or comment. Click the name of the person you want to contact, add a subject in the subject line, type your message and off you go! It is that simple. You can also use text formatting here, so feel free to add bold titles and big headers in your message.

In the left-hand column, you’ll see a list of conversations, with the title, profile picture of the person who started the conversation, the name of the last person to have replied to it, and to the right the number of contributions to the conversation (in grey; if there are unread messages this will be indicated in red), the time since the last contribution, and underneath, a “multiple persons” icon if there is more than one person other than you involved. Move your cursor over this icon to see who else is involved.

You can read a conversation by clicking it in the left-hand column, after which it will open on the right. At the top left you will find a list of recipients (including people who haven’t yet contributed to the conversation). Make sure to check this before starting to gossip! There may well be more people included in the conversation, all of whom will see your reply.

Replying to a conversation is pretty straightforward. Once it’s displayed on your screen, simply type your reply into the publisher window at the bottom of the conversation, and press the *Reply* button.

It is possible to delete a conversation from your item list. This can be done by selecting the conversation in the left-hand menu and then clicking the x in the top right corner. Blocking a conversation means you will delete it from the list of conversations and stop receiving any new replies. Please note that it is still possible for others to send replies to other participants in the conversation – you will just not receive them any more.
