## Where can I find my contacts?

You can find your list of contacts, sorted by aspects, by using the drop-down menu at the top right and selecting *Contacts*. The category selected by default is “My contacts” which lists all accounts that you're sharing with. On the left side you can select individual aspects and see the contacts that you put in this aspect. You can also add more of your contacts to an aspect here.

Read more about managing your aspects at “[What are aspects and how do I use them?][aspects]”

The lowest selection point is “Only sharing with me”. The people listed there are the ones that have added you to their aspects, but who are not (yet) in any of your aspects. In other words, they are sharing with you, but you are not sharing with them: you can think of this as them “following” you. If you add them to an aspect, they will then appear under that aspect and get removed from “Only sharing with me”.

While you see all the people only sharing with you, there's no list of people that you have added to one of your aspects but who have not added you to one of theirs. But you can see whether or not someone is sharing with you by visiting their profile page. If they are, there will be a green tick next to their diaspora\* ID. If they are not, there will be a gray circle.

If you add someone to an aspect, they won't see any posts published to this aspect before they became part of that aspect. However, they (and everyone else) can see your older public posts on your profile page, and they may also see them in their stream.

## What happens when I add someone to one of my aspects, or when someone adds me to one of their aspects?

Let’s say that Amy adds Ben to an aspect, but Ben has not (yet) added Amy to an aspect:

* Ben will receive a notification that Amy has “started sharing” with Ben.
* Amy will start to see Ben’s public posts in her stream.
* Amy will not see any of Ben’s private posts.
* Ben will not see Amy’s public or private posts in his stream.
* But if Ben goes to Amy’s profile page, then he will see the private posts that Amy makes to the aspect that she has placed him in (as well as her public posts, which anyone can see there).
* Ben will be able to see Amy’s private profile (biography, location, gender, birthday).
* Amy will appear under “Only sharing with me” on Ben’s contacts page.
* Amy will also be able to @mention Ben in a post.

This is known as asymmetrical sharing. If and when Ben also adds Amy to an aspect then it would become mutual sharing, with both Amy’s and Ben’s public posts and relevant private posts appearing in each other’s streams, and Amy would be able to view Ben’s private profile. They would then also be able to send each other private messages.
