title: How do I interact with posts?
category: User guides

Your main stream is populated with all of your contacts, tags you follow, and posts from some creative members of the community (Community spotlight). You can interact with all of your own posts and with posts by other users as well. To help diaspora\* pods perform faster, your stream won’t be constantly reloaded automatically. Just refresh the page whenever you want to check for updates to your stream.

## Basic interactions

There are three basic ways of interactions in diaspora\*. These are pretty straight-forward; you probably already used them without thinking about how these interactions work. They look different depending on which view you're using. If you're browsing your stream, you find the interaction links below the post you want to react to. If you're looking at a single post, there are reaction icons at the top right of the post you want to react to. The following explanation will use the description for stream view.

### Comments

If there are no comments on a post yet, click *Comment* to open a comment field. When there are already comments below the post, the comment field will automatically be there. If more than three comments have been added, the last three comments will be shown. You can expand the full thread by clicking the *Show n more comments* link above them.

### Likes

Next to the *Comment* link you will find a *Like* link. This can be used to give the owner of the post a sign that you have read and appreciated their post, without having to actually comment. When you click the link, you will be added to a counter of the number of likes. Clicking this counter will show you those people who have liked the post.

If you change your mind, you can remove your “like” by clicking the *Unlike* link which is now visible. But be aware that the person whose post you originally liked has already been sent a notification!

### Reshares

Public posts made by other people can be reshared. In order to reshare a post, click the *Reshare* link, which can be found between the *Like* and *Comment* links. Resharing a post makes it visible to your followers, and can help spread a good message to a new audience.

You can only reshare public posts and your reshare will also be public. There is no way to reshare private posts and also no way to reshare a public posts only to some of your aspects.

## How do I get notifications, or stop getting notifications, about a post?

You can chose if you want to receive notifications or stop getting notifications about a certain post. If you interact with a post in any way such as liking, commenting, or resharing this post, you will automatically receive notifications about future comments. You can disable these notification by hovering the post, and click the little bell icon that appears at the top right of the post. If the bell is gray, that means you aren’t currently receiving notifications of activity on this post. Click it to turn the bell black, and you will now receive notifications for this post. If you’re already receiving notifications and no longer want them, click the bell to turn it from black to gray. You will always receive all kinds of notifications for your own posts, and you can't disable notifications for those.

## What can I do if I receive abusing comments to my posts?

You can manage all discussions that take place below your own posts. If you receive abusive comments, or simply comments that you don't like below your posts, you can delete them. If you want to delete a comment, hover your mouse pointer over that comment, and a trash icon will appear in the top right corner, which allows you to delete the comment.

## Can I delete my own posts and comments?

You can delete all of your own posts and comments whenever you like. When you hover your mouse pointer over one of your own posts or one of your comments, a trash icon will appear in the top right corner, which allows you to delete the post or comment. You can also delete your own comments on other people's posts.  
If the post you want to delete is public and has already been reshared, these reshares will only display “post deleted by author” instead of your post after your deletion.

## What can I do if I don't like some posts in my stream?

If you don’t want to see someone else's post again, you can hide it from your stream. To do so, you need to hover your mouse pointer over to post and several icons will appear at the top right corner of the post. You can hide the post by clicking the x.

If you want all posts of a certain user to disappear from your stream, you can ignore this user. To ignore an account, click the ignore icon (a circle with a diagonal line through it) at the top right of one of their posts. Their posts will instantly disappear from your stream. Alternatively, go to their profile page and click the ignore icon there. You will still be able to see their posts on their profile page, or by using the single-post view.

You can find more information about how to deal with abusive content or users at “[What can I do if I encounter abusive content or users?][abusive_content]”.

## Can I use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the  stream?

If you want to navigate through your stream very quickly, you might want to use keyboard shortcuts instead of scrolling and clicking with your mouse. All basic interactions work with your keyboard, such as jumping between posts, likes, comments, reshares, etc. You can find the full list of available keyboard shortcuts at “[What are the different streams and how do I use them?][different_streams]”.
