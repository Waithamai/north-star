title: "Why is feature x not available in diaspora*?"
category: User guides
---

If you’ve just signed up, particularly if you’ve come from a feature-rich service, you’ve probably noticed that some of your favorite features are missing from diaspora\*.

We’d love diaspora\* to be as feature-rich as any other social platform, and we wish that we’d been able to add more features to the software in recent years. Why haven’t we?

The two main things that have held back development are:

1. The available developer resources.  
diaspora\* is built and maintained purely by volunteers working in their spare time. This means that there aren’t the resources to build everything that’s wanted, and priorities have to be made. We also need to make sure the code works properly and doesn’t disrupt the user experience in other ways. Sometimes “move fast and break stuff” isn’t the best policy!

2. Making sure that a feature is built right.  
We want diaspora\* to be a new type of social experience, not a clone of existing ones. When adding a feature, we first need to consider “is this really the best thing for a social network?” diaspora\* therefore won’t put effort into recreating the features found on other networks unless they are going to have a positive effect on this network, which might mean implementing them in a different way from what you’ve used elsewhere. We also won’t implement any features that don’t match diaspora*'s core principles of data ownership, privacy and freedom.

For both these reasons, we can never promise that a requested feature will be built into diaspora\*'s software, and certainly can’t guarantee a time frame for any addition.

That said, many of the features you want are already on our wish-list. This includes for example a mobile app, editing of posts, groups, events, and many more important features. So please, if you find something missing, don’t open a [GitHub ticket][github_issues] or start a [Discourse discussion][discourse_discussion] requesting it before checking if there’s an existing ticket or discussion about it. And please don’t add a comment on a GitHub or Discourse issue just to say “I want this feature!” or “How long before we get this?” That just creates noise and never helps to move things forward. It’s not a lack of desire that holds things up!

For many of these features, the groundwork has been done, and all that is needed is for someone or a group of people to step forward, claim the feature and get working! So if you want to help improve diaspora* by adding any of these features, or anything else, please introduce yourself! If you’re new to diaspora* development, have a look at our [guide to starting to contribute][get_involved]. If you choose to work on one of the features above, our core team will give you as much support as they can; although, given the voluntary nature of all work on diaspora*, it can sometimes take a long time to properly review a complex PR.
