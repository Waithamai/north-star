## Ignore a user

If you are currently sharing with that person, removing them from your aspects will stop many of their posts from appearing in your stream. A more complete method is to “ignore” that account. This will prevent any of their posts from appearing in your stream, and they will no longer be able to like or comment on your posts. They will, however, still be able to reshare your posts, comment on reshares of your posts, and their and their comments on other people's posts will still be visible to you.

To ignore an account, click the ignore icon (a circle with a diagonal line through it) at the top right of one of their posts. Their posts will instantly disappear from your stream. Alternatively, go to their profile page and click the ignore icon there. You will still be able to see their posts on their profile page and in single-post view.

## Report someone’s post

If you encounter an abusive post, you can click the alert triangle icon at the top right of the post to report it to your podmin. Enter a reason for reporting this post in the dialog box. Please only report posts that break our [community guidelines][community_guidelines] or your pod's terms of service, for example posts containing illegal content, abusive content or spam.

## Report a user

If you believe a user is sharing abusive content or violating the pod's terms of service, you can also report a user. This report is sent to your own podmin, who is not necessarily also the podmin of the user you want to report. This means, your podmin cannot completely delete the abusive user's account, they can only delete that user from their own pod.

## Contact your podmin

If you need to contact your podmin, you can find their contact email address on the left side of the stream at “Got a problem?”. You can then send them an email – but make sure you include all relevant information, like the reason for your message, links to posts, or user IDs.
