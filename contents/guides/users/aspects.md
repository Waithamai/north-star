## What is an aspect?

Think of your life and the people you know. Each person is a part of one or more aspects of your life. They might be a member of your family, a close friend, a work colleague or someone you play sport or music with or with whom you share a particular interest. They might be someone you just like sharing jokes with online. Or they might be part of more than one of these aspects of your life.

diaspora\* works in exactly the same way: Aspects are the way you group your contacts on diaspora\*.

You place contacts into one or more “aspects” of your life on diaspora\* based on which aspect(s) of your life they are part of. In this way, you control which of your contacts sees each post you make to diaspora\*, by posting to a particular aspect or aspects. This means that you can easily share the right things with the right people.

## How can I manage my aspects?

There are two different ways to access your list of aspects. You can either select *My aspects* in the left sidebar or use the drop-down menu at the top right and select *Contacts*. With both ways you can manage aspects and add or remove contacts.

### How do I add or delete aspects?

When you sign up you are given four aspects: Family, Work, Friends and Acquaintances. Of course you won’t be able to sort all of your life into just four standard aspects, so you can add some aspects. You can also delete the default aspects if you want to. Click *My aspects* in the sidebar and a list of your aspects will appear. To add an aspect, click + Add an aspect under the list of aspects in the menu. You will be presented with a pop-up window.

Your contacts will never see the name of the aspect you put them in so you can name your aspects whatever you want. If you want to rename them at some point, you can do this as well. Click “My aspects” in the left side-bar from a stream view and click the pencil icon by the aspect you want to rename, or go to your Contacts page and select the relevant aspect. Then click the edit icon next to the aspect name at the top of this page, change the name and press “Update”.

If you want to delete an aspect at some time, you can do this as well. It works similar to renaming aspects: Click “My aspects” in the left side-bar from a stream view and click the pencil icon by the aspect you want to delete, or go to your *Contacts* page and select the relevant aspect. Then click the trash icon in the top right of the page.

### How do I add contacts or remove them from my aspects?

For adding contacts to your aspects, simply hover over their user name. A hover card will open where you can select one or more aspects to put them in. They'll receive a notification that you started to share with them. Another way is to go to your *Contacts* page. For each contact you can use the menu on the right to add them to (or remove them from) as many aspects as you want. Or you can add them to a new aspect by clicking the aspect selector button on their profile page.

You can remove contacts from your aspects by removing them from all your aspects, until you're not sharing with them anymore. They don't receive a notification for being removed from your aspects.

## How do I publish posts to aspects?

You can select all aspects that you want to share your content with before publishing your post. Posts sent to aspects are always private and cannot be reshared. Once you have published your post, you can't change aspects anymore. People who were not in your aspect when you published your post won't receive it, even if you add them to that aspect later. You can set your default aspect to share posts with in your account settings.
